# <div style="text-align: center;">Blog</div>
---
A personal blog written with [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno), which serves static HTML files that are parsed from `articles/` Markdown files.

You can visit it [here](http://hum.sh).

I'm not sure why I didn't use a simpler method, but hey, it works.
